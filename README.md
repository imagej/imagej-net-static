This is a static version of the MediaWiki-based content of imagej.net,
from mid-July 2020. It was created as a stopgap while completing the
site's transition to GitHub Pages.

The new site sources can be found at [imagej.github.io].

The full history of the MediaWiki site was extracted using [Git-MediaWiki]
and merged into imagej.github.io; for the final MediaWiki-based sources,
see the [mediawiki-final] tag.
